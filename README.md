# Radiosonde-handler-from-Radiosondy.info
A Python program for Windows (with minor modifications also works with Linux) for handling LIVE data from the Radiosondy.info website and data analysis. If the sonde is flying at the target distance from home (defined in config.ini), send an email (Gmail). Only one email will be sent per sonde (stored in a local file). Linux files is upload, but not tested yet.
